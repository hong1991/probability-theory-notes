Random experiments are described by probability spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$
[Sample space](sample%20space.md) $\Omega$ is a nonempty set that contains (at least) all possible outcomes of the random experiment.
$\mathcal{A}$ denotes a $\sigma$-field[(sigma field)](sigma%20field.md) consisting of subset of $\Omega$.
$\mathbb{P} : \mathcal{A} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ is a [[probability measure]], is $\sigma$-additive.

Restrict $\mathcal{A}$ as a $\sigma$-field, cause mapping $\mathbb{P}$ should be $\sigma$-additive.
