In [[probability space]] $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$
$\mathbb{P}$ as probability measure is (apparently it is a [measure](measure.md)):
1. $\mathbb{P}(\emptyset)=0$ and $\mathbb{P}(\Omega)=1$ 
2. $\mathbb{P}$ is $\sigma$-additive, that is, for each sequence of disjoint sets $A_j \in \mathcal(A), j=1,2,...$, follows$$\mathbb{P}(\bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty}A_j)=\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}(A_j).$$
